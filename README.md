# Drink Recommendations
This application is meant to show users a list of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks, while also allowing them to add drinks to either list. 

# Usage
You can navigate the app using the navigation bar at the top of the page. If you click Alcoholic, it will take you to the page showing the list of alcoholic drinks. If you click Non-Alcoholic, it will take you to the page showing the list of non-alcoholic drinks. To add drinks to either list, go to the suggestion bar and fill out the empty fields, if inputted correctly then the submit button should not be disabled and you should be able to add your suggestion and see it in the appropriate list. 

# Source Data
I got the information for my JSON server from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.

# Stretch Goals
Create a search bar within the Alcoholic and Non-alcoholic pages so user can check if drink already exists in list. Tie in the like counter to the backend to keep track of all historical like history.
